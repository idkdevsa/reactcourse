## What is this?

This git contains my completed course work from Stephen Griders "Modern React with Redux". I highly recommend this course, it can be found [here on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux)

Stephen is a brilliant instructor! 

You can download the whole project and unzip to your desired location or clone. Each directory contains a separate mini app from a different section in the course.
In the desired app directory, first run:

### `npm install`

Installs the necessary node_modules.

And then:

### `npm start`

To start in your browser.

For now you will have to do this for every directory, or rather every app. I will be adding a main page to easily access all the mini apps for my own reference soon.
